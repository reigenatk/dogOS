Terminal read only returns when the enter key is pressed and should always add the newline character at the
end of the buffer before returning. Remember that the 128 character limit includes the newline character.

Terminal read should be able to handle buffer overflow (User types more than 127 characters) and situations
where the size sent by the user is smaller than 128 characters.

. If the user fills up one line by typing and hasnâ€™t typed 128 characters yet, you should roll over to the next line.
Backspace on the new line should go back to the previous line as well.
