1. Had a bug with keyboard input where if I typed too many keys at once, kernel would just close down. Was confused 
too because I had interrupts disabled during all of my key handling functions. Turns out the solution was to 
add some assembly linkage, by saving the registers onto the stack and the eflags as well. We do this in interrupt_wrapper.S

2. Had issue where RTC would only interrupt once and then never again. I deduced that this was because my 
send_eoi wasn't working, sure enough I was sending the wrong bytes.
