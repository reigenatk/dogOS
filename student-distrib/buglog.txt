1. Had a bug with keyboard input where if I typed too many keys at once, kernel would just close down. Was confused 
too because I had interrupts disabled during all of my key handling functions. Turns out the solution was to 
add some assembly linkage, by just calling IRET
We do this in interrupt_wrapper.S
This was really strange because 

2. Had issue where RTC would only interrupt once and then never again. I deduced that this was because my 
send_eoi wasn't working, sure enough I was sending the wrong bytes. 

3. uint8_t name[] = "hello"; instead of uint8_t name[5] = "hello"; with the first one working 
and the second one not. This was when writing tests. Not sure what the deal is, but 
the second one wasn't passing the string properly to the tests and hence causing a lot of 
problems.
